# Work History
 

## Week 1 ( First week of the project I was doing little bit research of the database, Becase I haven't done before any
 database normalisation how to find the primery and FOREIGN key.To understand all this concept it lot of time.


## Week 2 I have stared doing  database normalisation and created 9 tables, which took lots of time and I have some 
 mysql workbench issues for that reason it gives me error to convert excel sheet to sql.

## Week 3 I start doing the front-end coding 
## Week 4 working on the shiro loging page its also took time to connect database, finaly worked.
